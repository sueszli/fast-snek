the cpython interpreter is already pretty good at io-bound tasks through async/await.

but the GIL (global interpreter lock) hinders thread-parallelism in cpu-bound tasks.

you currently can only achieve parallelism in python through multiprocessing, which is not ideal for many use-cases.

the community is actively working on this by either trying to introduce multiple sub-interpreters [^subint1] [^subint2] or making the GIL optional [^nogil1] [^nogil2] [^nogil3].

until then, we can:

- use superset programming languages [^superset1] [^superset2]
- use different python implementations, like jit interpreters [^PyPy]
- use the `multiprocessing` standard library
- use c-python interop

## multiprocessing

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html (same api as `threading`, so they're interchangable)
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html (same functionality but more java-like)

when using the `multiprocessing` library in python, we are calling multiple system processes that each come with their own seperate python interpreter, GIL and memeory space.

this is very simple and straightforward, and the intended way to write parallel code in the latest python version. but it comes with all the pros and cons of using a processes for parallel programming:

- ‚úì simple.
- ‚úì higher isolation, security, robustness.
- ‚úì context switching: actually doesn't matter, since the `threading` library uses kernel-level threads.
- ùôì resource overhead: memory allocation, creation and management.
- ùôì serialization overhead: there is no shared memory, so data has to be serialized and deserialized for inter-process communication. also some objects are unserializeable: the `pickle` module is used to serialize objects. but some objects are not pickleable (i.e. lambdas, file handles, etc.).

## c from python: c extension modules

- https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html

- extending cpython with modules in which the gil is manually released. we can then call those modules in multithreaded python code.
- the rust extension libraries are promising and used in some new popular projects [^rust1] [^rust2] but contain unsafe code [^rustunsafe] and are generally still too immature.
- alternatively you can also use cython (not to be confused with cpython) for code generation. it's heavily optimized and used by numpy and lxml but a lot more limiting than writing the extension modules by hand in c. 

- pros:
     - most performant. we are calling c functions inside the c interpreter. this way we can move compute into the extension.
- cons:
     - very complex api. data isn't marshalled automatically.
     - not portable. we must link cpython during the build step to extend it. but fortunately there are nice build tools to simplify this [^setuptools].

## c from python: ctypes (foreign function interface)

- https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html
- https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#main-mode-of-usage

- writing a shared library in c (or any other language providing a c interface [^nogolang]). we can then call those libraries in multithreaded python code.

- pros:
     - very performant.
     - very simple.
     - gil is released automatically on each foreign function call [^release].
- cons:
     - deserialization overhead: we are effectively calling another process from python. automatic type conversions done by the ffi-library are very expensive [^ctypebad]. but fortunately this can be circumvented by passing pointers.
     - call overhead.

1. try to move as much of the computation as possible into the extension, to reduce python prep overhead, serialization costs, and function call overhead.
2. if you‚Äôre dealing with large numbers of objects, reduce serialization overhead by having a custom extension type that can store the data with minimal conversions to/from Python, the way NumPy does with its array objects.
